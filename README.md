> Practical refactoring examples

Refactoring is an important tool in any developer's toolbox. It's the key to turning bad code into clean code. Our mission is to showcase practical examples that help you master the art of refactoring.

All of our examples are adapted from code in real production applications. The problem domain may have been changed, but the structure of the code and the refactoring approach has not.

## Development üíª

The blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme is adapted from [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

Install the dependencies using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```
bundle install
```

Start a local Jekyll server:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You'll then be able to visit a local version of the blog at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).
