> Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which "too small to be worth doing". However the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant.

Refactoring is an important tool in any developer's toolbox. It's the key to turning bad code into clean code. Our mission is to showcase practical examples that help you master the art of refactoring.

All of our examples are adapted from code in real production applications. The domain may have been changed, but the structure of the code and the refactoring approach has not.
